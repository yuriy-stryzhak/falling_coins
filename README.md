# Falling Coins Animation

This project is a simple interactive screen where, upon tapping, coins fall from the top of the screen and gradually fill up the screen.

## Requirements

- Coins will fill the screen up to a certain level (80% of screen height). Once this level is reached, additional taps will not cause more coins to fall until the number of coins on the screen decreases.
- The task is optimized for mobile platforms.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Tap anywhere on the screen to start the coin animation.

## Notes

- You can replace the coin image URL in the `style.css` file with your own image.
- The maximum number of coins can be adjusted by modifying the `maxCoins` variable in the `script.js` file.
